Let’s now summarize some key
lessons about financial engineering. The previous lessons showed that startup
valuation is more an art than science. There is room for bargaining and the
quality of an entrepreneurial team makes a great difference in terms
of perceived risks and benefits. When you launch your company, remember not to give founders’
equity to non-strategic associates. There are other ways of incentivizing
and compensating them, like commissions, stock
options and bonuses. Conversely, do not try
to keep a majority stake if it impedes your company’s growth. When it comes to raising new equity, never forget that a capital increase
represents your acceptance to share information and the control
of your company with new investors. Make sure that their long term
goals are compatible with yours before you accept their money. Also, do not plan more than
one capital increase per year. It usually takes six
months to get the money. You should raise enough equity to reach the next significant
technical or commercial milestone and you should anticipate delays, which are very frequent
in the world of startups. In the same vein, it is sometimes
as difficult to get $100k as $1M. If your pre-money
valuation is not too low, raise as much money as you can, because you will certainly need
more than initially planned. Having said this, you should
work with professionals to maximize the probability
of finding the best investors. You should hire a fundraiser
and as well as seasoned lawyer to assist you in the
fundraising process. Look for smart money and have a plan B. There is currently a lot of money
available to finance ambitious projects, but not all investors are equal. Hence, look for smart
money, not just any money. Smart money providers are mainly
experienced and renowned investors, who will open many doors and
boost your company’s prospects. When you contact potential
investors, the initial stages are crucial. Be conscious of their
main screening criteria. They almost always focus
on the team and the market. If you succeed in signing a term
sheet, even a very detailed one, don’t forget this is still the
beginning of the negotiation and the deal can be
canceled at the last minute. Don’t lose momentum in
a fundraising process, otherwise your bargaining
power will decrease and you may risk being obliged
to accept less favorable terms. You should always have a plan B,
to be free to refuse a bad deal. Once you make a deal,
you will have to manage the interdependence
among all the shareholders, including the alignment of
interests and the power relations. Therefore, you should never try to
maximize the pre-money valuation without considering other key issues
like the VC’s network, reputation and the touchiest provisions
of a shareholders’ agreement like liquidation preferences,
ratchets and bad leaver clauses. Even a generous valuation is just
virtual wealth for you and your associates. You will only be rich once cashed out. Do not make overly sophisticated
deals. Keep it simple. The essence of a deal can generally
be summarized on a single page and may be sealed by a handshake. I have personally never seen
contracts as thick as Tolstoy's diaries, be more effective than a relatively
simply formulated win-win deal. But you should really work with the
best legal and financial professionals to reach a balance where the interests
of all shareholders are durably aligned. Corporate finance is
seldom rocket science. After these few lessons, you have probably noticed that
corporate finance is not rocket science. Most concepts are quite simple, and they are even mundane if you
begin to play with my Excel tools. The valuation concepts
introduced in this module do not apply only to VC financing. You may apply the same reasoning
to carry out a capital increase involving your friends,
family or business angels. Numerous financial mechanisms
exist to reduce valuation gaps between founders and new investors, but the essence of startup
financing is a win-win game. Investors seldom win when
the entrepreneurs lose, and the opposite is also true. Finally, your ambition and your
ability to deliver are more important than a financial forecast. This is only the translation
of those elements. What about funding the ideal startup? What are some of the
main evaluation criteria considered by prospective
investors in a startup? For an investor in a startup,
the main evaluation criterion is the entrepreneurial team. The business plan is only one
aspect of the due diligence process. In a business plan, the financial
forecasts are highly summarized because investors do not expect
to deal with chartered accountants. Let me reiterate what
professional investors look for in an investment proposal. A good business plan
presents a real need, a credible offer to
meet such a need, an ambitious and professional
team, a clear market, a real value proposition, a competitive
advantage to beat the competition, a clear roadmap and data
proving one’s assumptions. In other words, you should use
storytelling to present a real pain point expressed by a clearly
defined market segment, treated by an exclusive technology
and an adapted solution. Your team should inspire trust for its
competence and entrepreneurial drive. You should also be able to define
and quantify your value proposition and position yourself in
relation to your competitors. Your financial forecasts should reflect credible commercial and
technical milestones and you should have ample
data to demonstrate that there is already some traction. If you address all these
items in a convincing way, you will probably schedule
numerous meetings with potential financial backers, who will be eager to meet you in person to check what is behind your executive
summary and/or your slide deck.

************************************************************************
Welcome to lesson 3. In the previous lessons of this module, we discussed the mechanism
of a capital increase and presented the methods and
tools used to value a company. In this lesson, we will speak about term
sheets and shareholders’ agreements, which are documents that encode
the various terms and conditions of a capital increase. Let’s go back to the process
of a capital increase. First let me ask you a question. What are the situations
leading to a capital increase? The founder of a startup will
generally conduct a capital increase when new capital or talent is
needed to finance or support the technical and/or commercial
development of the company. The new shareholders will
generally be minority shareholders, although after several
rounds of financing outside investors may
control your company. When you decide whether to
bring any given potential investors into the capital of your company, the negotiated pre-money
valuation is an important criterion but it should not be the only one. An investment proposal
with a higher valuation may actually be less favorable
than another investment proposal with a lower valuation
because of other differences between the proposed deals. In most cases, professional
investors, like venture capital funds, negotiate a series of terms with the
existing owners of the company in which they invest
to align the interests of all or at least the main shareholders. These terms are summarized
in a term sheet and, ultimately, in a
shareholders’ agreement that is signed by all of the
company’s shareholders or sometimes only between the
principal existing shareholders and the new investors. Almost no professional investor
will fund an early stage company without such a shareholders’ agreement because such investors
are quite demanding and they will not consider the
negotiated valuation of your company to be enough to frame
your relationship. Sometimes, a company’s
charter is not enough. Normally, the relationships among a
company’s shareholders are governed by its constitutional
documents or charter. A company’s charter includes
articles of incorporation which regulate the company's
relationships with outside parties. The articles of incorporation are
generally filed for public reference. Articles of association, or bylaws that
regulate the company’s management, internal procedures and financing. The articles of association
are often private but have to be filed
publicly in some countries. A company’s charter therefore
contains public information and it may be rather expensive
to amend it substantially in connection with
each capital increase. A shareholders’ agreement
is usually desirable to allow for greater
confidentiality and flexibility as well as to protect the
interests of minority shareholders. In any case, a shareholders’
agreement is not a mundane document and legal DIY can be much
costlier at the end of the day than working with a top-tier
lawyer to negotiate a win-win deal between founders and investors. Your lawyer will help you negotiate
the agreement with the VC’s lawyers, because an entrepreneur cannot
constantly be at the front line of such a complex transaction. Let’s now examine some key components
of a shareholders’ agreement. Although each contract
is highly customized, shareholders’ agreements for
startups address the following topics. First, the contract specifies the parties
and the main goals of the agreement, such as objectives related to liquidity. Second, the contract regulates
voting rights and the ownership of the company’s shares
in various circumstances. Third, the contract regulates
the management of the company, notably the composition of the
board of directors and voting rules for some specific corporate resolutions. Last but not least, the contract
includes provisions for the resolution of future potential disputes
between shareholders. Such shareholders’ agreements
can be more than 20 pages long and signing numerous original
copies for all the shareholders can be quite time-consuming. The key parties to such a contract
are the venture capital investors on the one hand and
the founders on the other. Other minority shareholders may sign
a reduced version of this contract, including rights and duties related
to the sale of their shares. Before a shareholders’
agreement is drafted, entrepreneurs should negotiate
a rather detailed term sheet addressing the key items of the
future shareholders’ agreement. Otherwise, the negotiation of the
shareholders’ agreement may last a while and some private equity funds may
come up with unexpected conditions that may put you in a corner. Many entrepreneurs have
experienced this painful situation. That’s why you should, again,
work with seasoned lawyers and make the deal as clear as possible. Let’s now analyze a typical term sheet
and explain some touchy clauses.

************************************************************************
Welcome back. In the last video, we explained the
importance of a shareholders’ agreement and noted some of its key components. In this video, we will examine some of
the major items addressed in a term sheet and eventually in the
shareholders’ agreement. You can download
numerous free term sheets and shareholders’ agreement templates, but it is often difficult for
a first-time entrepreneur to understand some major items
such as liquidity, drag-along or tag-along rights,
liquidation preferences or even “bad leaver”
and ratchet clauses. Let’s explain some of these items to understand what VCs
and entrepreneurs tend to negotiate so as to
preserve their interests. A group of French tech entrepreneurs
created “The Galion Project”, a think tank for entrepreneurs
hoping to create high-growth startups that may become tomorrow’s unicorns. The founder of this think
tank is Jean-Baptiste Rudelle, a serial entrepreneur who among
other things, created Criteo, a personalized retargeting
company launched in 2005 that went public eight years later
on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. Pierre Kosciusko-Morizet,
the cofounder of PriceMinister, is also a member of the
Board of this association, whose motto is “think and play”. The Galion Project
organizes informal meetings, notably for entrepreneurs
passionate about kitesurfing, but this is another story. Let me just focus on some documents
shared by this group of entrepreneurs. One of these documents is
a typical series A term sheet, which you can find among
the materials for this lesson. This document was created with
the help of two prominent law firms and is already used by several VC firms. The document is made up of 32 items which are a good starting
point for negotiation between entrepreneurs and investors. Some “hard” contractual clauses like
ratchets are absent from this term sheet, which is quite reassuring
for an entrepreneur. However, the term sheet
is not totally favorable for the founders of a new venture and you should not accept everything if you have a strong
bargaining position. Let’s now analyze some of the
clauses contained in this term sheet. A liquidity clause is essential, because it demonstrates that seed-stage
and venture capital investors do not intend to hold shares
of your company forever. As we have already seen, they will
want to exit as quickly as possible, preferably within five years. Liquidity is seen mainly as
the sale of your company or an IPO on a
recognized stock exchange. If such a liquidity event is not achieved
in five years for series A investors, they generally negotiate the right
to require the Board of the company to hire a recognized investment bank
to sell the company or initiate an IPO. Such a clause probably explains why the French VC-backed
fintech Le Compte Nickel was sold just five years
after its incorporation. This “nickel account” helped
people open a bank account with licensed owners of small
French shops called “tabacs” with just an ID card and €20. The nickel account system
doesn’t allow an overdraft but it is a serious competitor
for traditional retail banks. This startup was acquired in
2017 for more than €200M by a leading European bank, which is quite funny for a fintech whose initial claim was to be
“the bank account without a bank”. Now, let’s move to
another type of clause. Do you know what drag-along
and tag-along clauses are? Drag-along clauses are a consequence of private equity
investors’ liquidity target. Such clauses state that all shareholders will be required to sell their
shares if an offer is made by any third party to acquire all
of the shares in the company, provided that such an offer is accepted by the holders of more
than a certain percentage, i.e. 75% of the company’ shares. A drag-along clause prevents
minority shareholders from refusing to sell their
shares to get a higher price or any other reason. Symmetrically, tag-along rights,
also called co-sale rights, are clauses that protect
minority shareholders if majority shareholders or other
shareholders wish to sell to a third party. In such a case, minority shareholders
have the right to join the transaction. Otherwise, their shareholding
could become almost worthless because any acquirer could
obtain control of a company without dealing with them. Let’s move to liquidation preferences. Liquidation preferences are a key
item sometimes imposed by investors to preserve their return in
case of a potential downsize. Concretely, the liquidation
preference clause in the term sheet from the
Galion Project specifies, “In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution, winding up, merger, sale or other disposition of
the assets of the company in which the shareholders
do not own a majority of the outstanding shares
of the surviving entity, the holders of the Series A shares
shall be entitled to receive, in preference to all other shareholders, a per share amount equal to
the price per share they paid when they financed the company. Thereafter, the remaining
proceeds (if any) shall be distributed pro rata to the
holders of ordinary shares and Series A.” Sometimes, series A investors even
negotiate liquidation preferences based on the price they paid
when they financed the company plus a yearly yield of 10% or even 15%. In such a case, any remaining proceeds would again be distributed
pro rata to all shareholders, including the investors. This clearly shows that the
company’s management has to create a significant value
above the invested equity. Otherwise, these founders and managers will get almost nothing
out of a future exit.

************************************************************************
Hello! In this video, we
will conclude our discussion on term sheets and
shareholders’ agreements by explaining some
particularly sensitive clauses and adding a final word on
unity among co-founders. Let’s explore good and
bad leaver clauses. Good leaver clauses and bad
leaver clauses specify the terms of the potential transfer
of all or a portion of a departing co-founder’s shares
to the remaining shareholders depending on the reasons
for such a departure. These clauses are also
called early leaver clauses. The purpose of such clauses is to deter
founders from leaving the company after an early financing round until
critical milestones are reached. Often, these clauses aim
to prevent the founders from departing for five years. A bad leaver is someone who is dismissed for damaging the business in some way,
such as fraud or gross misconduct. According to the Galion Project term
sheet introduced in the last video, “All shares held by such founder may be purchased at their nominal value by the active founders and the new
investors, pro rata among them.” Selling your shares at a nominal value
just means getting back the equity you invested initially
to create the company, generally only a few thousand dollars. In other words, you just get your money back
with absolutely no capital gain. Departing as a good leaver may
be related to several circumstances such as death or mental
or physical incapacity. In such a case, the other founders and
the new investors will have a call option on all the shares of the departing
founder at their fair market value. Such clauses are very touchy
and founders may be cautious before accepting them in a
shareholders’ agreement. However, even before outside
investors and shareholders’ agreements, it is necessary for the cofounders
to provide for the case where one of them wants
to leave after a short time. Such a departing founder should not
be able to keep all of his or her shares, because it would destroy the
motivation of the remaining founders to develop the business. When the company is launched, the co-founders can therefore
establish a rule such as, “If one of us leaves the
company within five years, he/she will give back to the other
founders all of his/her shares less one fifth of these shares
per year since incorporation. The sale will be carried
out at nominal value, pro rata among the other co-founders.” Let’s move now to rachets. Do you know what ratchets are? Ratchets are anti-dilution protections. Full ratchets allow an investor to adjust
his or her percentage of ownership after an additional round of
financing with a lower share price. This is called a down round. Let’s consider an early
venture capital investor, who bought 1M shares at $2 each
during a $2M series A financing round. If the company were to conduct
a series B financing round with a new share price of $1, this investor would be given
an additional 1M shares to compensate for the
50% lower valuation. Technically, these new shares
would be transferred at par value from the co-founders to this investor. Ratchets may lead to some paradoxes. In our example, the venture capital fund invested $2M
during the series A financing round. If a subsequent financing round
occurs on a pre-money valuation lower than $2M, the new pre-money valuation
would be below the former amount of equity invested. You can understand easily that
this would lead to a huge problem and probably tense negotiations because the founders would
not be able to compensate the decline in valuation. Mathematically, this would
force the co-founders to end up with a negative percentage
of shares, which is impossible. This example is similar to what we
saw with liquidation preferences. It shows that founders and managers have to create a significant
value above the invested equity. Otherwise they will get almost
nothing out of a future deal. Sometimes, VCs negotiate
weighted average ratchet clauses. These are less harsh than full
ratchets in the case of a down round. If a new financing round
occurs at a lower share price, the early venture capital investors
would receive additional shares based on a weighted average formula. With full ratchets or weighted
average ratchet clauses, investors try to protect their
interests in case of down rounds. This is quite logical from
the investors’ point of view. However, as a founder of the company, you should be very cautious
about accepting ratchet clauses because they may impact your
ability to restructure your company if it faces hard times and
its valuation dwindles. Are shareholders’
agreements a paper tiger? We could analyze other important
clauses of a shareholders’ agreement, but this is not a corporate law course. Again, you should probably
work with a lawyer to conduct crucial negotiations. Some entrepreneurs use standard bylaws and free shareholders’ agreement
templates to avoid legal expenses. These templates may help you
understand several key issues, but every company is unique
and faces specific issues. Hence these initial savings are risky and may ultimately cost
you more than you saved. This lesson on shareholders’
agreements is intended to warn you that you should not sign anything
without careful consideration and legal advice, even if your
bargaining power is weak. It also shows that co-founders
are doomed to stay united. The departure of a co-founder
often has huge consequences and the leaver can rarely
keep all his or her shares. Creating a startup
is like Hotel California, the famous song by the
Eagles, released in 1977. The lyrics end with this line, “You can check out any time you
like, but you can never leave!” In the end, a shareholders’
agreement remains a paper tiger and is often difficult to enforce. In the case of litigation,
everybody loses because this may damage
the company’s dynamics. If problems arise between shareholders, remember, “A bad settlement is
often better than a good trial.”

After having raised all that money, how
do you manage all your shareholders? Well, I don't think
I have the answers. I think that was the
hardest part of the job. Should I consider them as partners,
enemies, bankers, my boss? I would say partly all of this. The more you are in contact with
them, the better you know each other, so when you raise money
please do your due diligence. They do their due diligence, they can
put you almost naked, I would say. But do your due diligence
and please ask them to be in contact with some of their
participation where they failed. Because when you're in trouble, that's
when you see the real nature of people. The press is saying that we sold the
company between 70 million and 120, and the press is pretty well aware of
the number, I'm not allowed to share it, but I have this deep
feeling that in three years I would have been able to sell it
at 500 million, with no doubt. And the fact that the VCs have
a different agenda from yours, even if you know they
have to, I'm not naive, I know that at some point you have to
get out and they want to make an exit. But when you raise
money with a VC, it's a wedding knowing that
you're going to divorce, so please before, get engaged,
you know the old way, get to know your fiancé
before getting married, because the harder the
situation, the stronger the divorce. Thanks a lot for this testimonial.
I have a last question. In three words, what would you
recommend to future entrepreneurs? Listen to your heart. Great! Thanks a lot Julien.

Before concluding this course, I would like to point out
the importance of creating an efficient financial information
system within your startup. This topic is thoroughly addressed
in Sebastian Becker’s course, so I will simply insist on the fact that a management dashboard is essential to visualize comprehensively
the evolution of the main financial and non-financial parameters
of your company’s activity. If we focus on accounting
and financial parameters, such indicators may
include the following: sales, gross margin, EBITDA, cash
flow, working capital requirements, break-even point, customer
receivables and your cash position. The relevant indicators will naturally
vary depending on your industry and your development stage. The dashboard of a company selling
prestige loudspeakers around the world will be quite different from a biotech
company developing a new molecule. There are a number of recipients
of a management dashboard. The CEO and the board members will
have access to high-level indicators and they should be able to stay informed on any strategic, commercial,
financial or human resource aspect of their company. Functional managers will
naturally create and receive a lot of specific
performance indicators. Shareholders should also benefit
from comprehensive information on the situation and
prospects of their company, e.g. to discuss a
proposed capital increase. This requirement for relevant
indicators to support business and investment decisions is
summed up by Lucien Lapasin, an experienced business angel
and founder of an investment firm, "If you do not have this management
visibility, you run into a wall. You are trying to drive a vehicle
without a steering wheel or with a simple handle,
without windshield, without fuel gauge (about
your cash), without seatbelt, without destination/customers,
without any map, without lights, without knowing who
precedes you, or follows you and could overtake you! And you ask me to get on
board with a big gas can?! This is not very serious …" What management information systems have
you put in place in your own companies and what key indicators
do you follow right now? Do these indicators allow you to assess
the performance of your company and anticipate possible
deviations from your forecasts? Let me also address
the issue of governance. When you start a new venture, you generally cannot afford a structured
board with specialized committees like a listed company. But successful startups set up
impressive advisory boards immediately to benefit from relevant
feedback and more credibility in the eyes of future investors. Tech startups may even create a
board with prominent scientists, sometimes even Nobel prize winners. If you are currently launching a startup,
can you name four to six people that you would like to join
your company’s advisory board? My next recommendation would
be to contact these people to ask them to join your board? You may be surprised by how
many experienced business people are eager to innovate by
proxy and accept to be part of a promising new
venture as an advisor. My personal experience as
an advisory board member and a board member of a listed company
enables me to offer the following advice. A member of an advisory board should
be experienced in your company’s industry and/or development stage. Be critical, preferably not
in public, but benevolent. Not be egocentric and on the contrary,
understand the dynamics of a board. Be available for regular board
meetings and unexpected calls. Be ready to share his or her network
and carry out ad-hoc missions. Such an advisor may not necessarily
be your friend but has to be your ally. The compensation for such advisors may be shares, options
or even attendance fees when the company goes public, but at the beginning most advisors
do not get any cash payment. On the contrary, they may
even help you raise new funds. Ultimately, the relationship among
shareholders, the board and the CEO will be a subtle system
of checks and balances.

Now it’s time to conclude this
entrepreneurial finance course. As you have noticed, financial issues are
closely linked with personal tradeoffs. When we select candidates for our HEC Challenge + executive
program for tech entrepreneurs, we ask them, among other things, where do you see your
company in 10 years? Where do you see yourself in 10 years? What is a successful
entrepreneur according to you? Before diving into spreadsheets, you first have to define your
business and personal goals. Numerous surveys show that
money is not the main driver for those who choose to take
the leap into entrepreneurship. Instead, their key motivations are more often related to gaining
freedom or pursuing personal development. This leads us to find the famous
intersection, popularized by the Japanese, between what you love, what you
are good at, what the world needs and what you can be paid for. Entrepreneurship may be a
good way to find your “ikigai”, or in English, your purpose. By aligning passion, mission,
profession and vocation, you can find where you are truly happy. There is often a shaky balance
between money and ideas. Currently however, there is a lot of
money available for brilliant ideas, which makes our era quite exciting. Beyond strategic and financial plans,
creating and developing a new venture is above all a human adventure. Let me end this course with
some final recommendations. Define your personal and your
professional risk threshold. Go out into the field and
periodically take some distance. Develop your professional network. Hold various executive and
non-executive, i.e. as a startup advisor. Carefully select your
associates and your employees. Sell and look at your
cash almost every day. Strike a balance between
independence and hyper-growth. Have fun. A new venture is not
only risky, it’s also an adventure. Even if this may seem paradoxical, I encourage you both to be 
realistic and to pursue your dreams. It was a pleasure for
me to teach this course and I would like to
thank all the colleagues who helped me create and record it. Without them, nothing
would have been possible, like many new ventures including
this HEC online Master’s. Goodbye, and I wish you all the best in the creation and the
development of your new ventures.

What is a capital increase? In this video, we’ll explain
the process of a capital increase. Some of you have probably watched
the movie The Social Network. In this movie, inspired by
the creation of Facebook, one of the company’s
founders, Eduardo Saverin, experiences a huge dilution when his
shareholding plummets from 30% to 0.3%. In real life, your shares
can become worthless in a single financial operation. Technically this is called a wash out. Finance is ruthless. Be aware that reality can
often be even worse than the power relations depicted
in a movie like The Social Network or in a TV series like Silicon Valley. It means that entrepreneurs must
carefully choose their investors, but the opposite is also true. Let’s now explain the basic
principles of a capital increase. Which of the following does
a capital increase involve? Creating new shares, or selling existing shares
to increase your capital. Answer 1 is correct. A capital increase consists
of creating new shares and not selling existing ones. If your company has bright prospects, the price at which you can
issue these new shares, may be much higher than the price
at which you issued earlier shares. The company’s founders keep their shares but, since they generally do not invest
in the following financing rounds, they are diluted, which means that their
percentage of ownership diminishes. However, the founders are richer
since the share price increases. Let us take an example
to make this clear. If you apply this reasoning
to your own startup, you will master these concepts
of valuation and dilution easily, as they are not very complicated. In order to make life simpler,
I even created an Excel tool to model the evolution of a company’s
valuation and shareholding. This file is called IngeFi and you've probably already
downloaded it from the platform. Let’s analyze an example of
two successive capital increases. Let’s assume that you and your
partners created a startup whose current capital is $15k, split into 15,000 shares
issued for $1 each. This initial value of $1 per
share is called the par value. Imagine that a pool of business angels
agrees to a capital infusion of $500k in exchange for ownership
of 25% of your company. What is therefore
your company’s valuation and the number of new
shares to be issued? To understand the situation, let’s compare the company’s
shareholding with a cake. If these business angels receive
25% of the cake for $500k, the total value of the cake must
logically be four times larger, i.e. $2M. This $2M is called the
post-money valuation, because this is the company’s
value after the capital increase. Since the new investors own
25% of the company’s equity after this capital increase,
the founders are diluted. Their ownership percentage
falls from 100% to 75%. The founders therefore
get diluted by 25%. The value of the founders’ shares
is 75% of $2M, i.e. $1.5M. This is called the pre-money valuation. The wording itself makes
the calculation easy because pre-money plus new
money equals post-money. Technically, the new investors
do not buy existing shares. They receive new shares so
that their number of shares is 25% of the total number
of shares outstanding. Knowing that the initial
number of shares was 15,000, you can calculate easily the number
N of new shares to be issued by solving the following equation. N divided by N plus 15,000 equals 25%. N equals 5,000 new shares. Since the investors receive
5,000 new shares for $500k, the new share price is $100. The par value remains $1, meaning that there is an issuance
premium of $99 per share. At the end of this operation,
there are 20,000 shares, each worth $100. Again, we see that the company’s
post-money valuation is $2M. Let’s now apply this reasoning
to a second capital increase. Imagine that your
startup is growing quickly, and you need an additional capital
increase to fuel such growth. After a few meetings, a venture
capital fund negotiates a capital infusion of $2M in exchange for
20% of your company. What are therefore your company’s
number of new shares to be issued? Post-money valuation? Pre-money valuation? And what is the new share price? To answer these questions, let’s use
the metaphor of the cake again. If the venture capital fund
gets 20% of the cake for $2M, the total value of the cake
is logically five times greater, i.e. $10M. This $10M is the company’s
post-money valuation. Since the venture capital fund
controls 20% of the company’s equity after this capital increase, the founders and the business
angels are diluted by 20%, which means multiplying their
current shareholding by 0.8. The founders’ shareholding therefore
becomes 75% times 0.8 equals 60%. The business angels’ shareholding
becomes 25% times 0.8 equals 20% and the rest of the cake, i.e. 20%,
goes to the venture capital fund, as already said. The pre-money valuation of
the company is therefore $8M, if you remember the formula pre-money
plus new money equals post-money. Since the number of shares before
the capital increase was 20,000, we can again compute the number
N of new shares to be issued by solving the following equation. N divided by N plus 20,000 equals 20%. One easily finds that N
equals 5,000 new shares. Since the VC fund receives
5,000 shares for $2M, the new price per share is $400. The par value remains $1, meaning that the issuance
premium is $399 per share. At the end of the operation, there
are 25,000 shares each worth $400. We can see again that the company’s
post-money valuation is $10M. With such computations, you can
now analyze most capital increases, even for listed companies.

Welcome back. In the previous video, we explained
the nature and implications of a capital increase using an example
of two successive capital increases. This example shows that a capital
increase can usually be summarized by the creation of a given number of
new shares and by a new share price. The number of new shares impacts the
dilution of the existing shareholders. The new share price reflects
the valuation of the company, since the post-money valuation
will simply be this new share price multiplied by the number
of shares outstanding. For a listed company, the share
price changes continually. In the universe of private equity, the revaluation of new ventures or
growth companies is not as frequent, but the same logic applies when it
comes to the valuation of a company, i.e. during a capital increase. One of the main differences is, however,
the relative absence of liquidity, which raises the exit issues already
addressed in our previous module. Let’s now go back to the
PriceMinister business case that we introduced
at the end of Module 1. This company experienced a
great variety of financial operations, financing from business angels, growth
capital financing, mergers with peers and issuance of stock options
for the company’s managers. Before being acquired for
€200M by the Rakuten Group, PriceMinister’s shareholding
was the following. The founders had a 22.5% stake. They had only invested €40k
in exchange for 400,000 shares. The founders were diluted by 87.5%, but they received €45M from Rakuten. The business angels had a 24.4% stake. They had invested €2.7M in the
company in the first two years and they received about
€49M from Rakuten. The two growth capital funds
controlled 13.7% of the company, having invested €10.7M. The managers and the other employees
received 112,000 stock options, representing 6.3% of the
company on a fully-diluted basis, i.e. assuming exercise
of all the options. The beneficiaries of these options
received about €12.6M from Rakuten. The shareholders of the
four companies acquired controlled 33.2% of
PriceMinister’s capital and received about €66M
after Rakuten’s takeover. I modeled these successive
operations in an Excel file called IngeFi-PriceMinister, where you can understand the logic
of these successive financial operations. This file can be downloaded
from the platform. I rounded some figures pertaining
to the amounts invested but the number of shares
is exactly the same as the shareholding of the real company. Even though information about the
valuation of successive financial rounds is often confidential, I found relevant data in the
company’s articles of incorporation, which is public information. These data helped me compute
the successive valuations and the shareholders’ dilution. This file shows, for instance,
that the CEO’s shareholding drops from 33% to 7.4%, but at the end these shares
are worth nearly €15M. The initial share price was
multiplied by more than 1,000. I hope that you are now familiar
with the process of a capital increase and the concepts of
valuation and dilution. In order to facilitate
your future calculations, let me also share with you
another tool called FastValo, which is also available on the platform. This tool comprises two tabs. The first one, called FastValo, provides numerous types
of financial calculations. The second one, called ValFlux, shows valuations using the
discounted cash flow method. Let’s focus on the first tab, which may help you juggle the
financial engineering concepts which have been introduced previously,
pre-money and post-money valuation, dilution, money-multiples
and annual return. The first box gives you the
annual return of an investment with a given duration
and money-multiple, i.e. a money multiple of two
achieved within five years corresponds to an annual yield of 14.9%. The second box computes the
future value of an investment and the corresponding money-multiple
for a given investment term and a given annual return. For instance, €250k invested over five
years at an annual return rate of 22% generates €675.7k, which
represents a money-multiple of 2.7. The third box computes the
present value of an investment for a given future value, a given investment term
and a given discount rate, i.e. a future value of
€500k in five years discounted at a yearly rate of 10% corresponds to a present value of €310.5k. And so on. If you use this tool
for your own startup, you will rapidly get familiar with the
basic concepts of financial engineering and you will avoid confusing pre-money
with post-money valuations, which is a very common and sometimes
costly mistake among entrepreneurs. As you can see, understanding a
capital increase is not very complicated from a technical point of view. However, it raises many other issues, notably the alignment of interests
with the new shareholders, which we will discuss in the next video.

************************************************************************
Hello and welcome back. In the previous two videos, we discussed
the process of a capital increase and the concepts of
valuation and dilution. We will now speak about the issues and
considerations involved in the decision to open up your company’s
capital to outside investors. According to you, what are some reasons why an
entrepreneur might want to open up the capital of his or her company? An entrepreneur can open up the capital
of their company for various reasons, such as the desire to involve new talent
in the development of the company or the need to find capital to grow. Before analysis of the opportunity
for a capital increase, the simple distribution of capital
at the start of a business can be very informative. This often reflects the
willingness of an entrepreneur to surround himself or
herself with partners and share power within
his or her company. Some companies are created
and run by entrepreneurs who control most or all of the capital. There are, however,
few growth companies that can develop without
new partners and investors whose capital contributions
will mechanically decrease the percentage held by the founder. One serial entrepreneur
with whom I am acquainted regularly stated that he
surrounded himself with people who were much better
than him in many fields and that he preferred to hold 1% of
the capital of a multinational company than 100% of a micro-company. This preference for fast growth had
also led him to finance his businesses via leading venture capital funds. Following the IPO of one of his
startups five years after its inception, this CEO held only 5% of the
capital and some stock options, but the market capitalization of
this listed company approached €1bn. On the level of wealth creation, the option chosen was
therefore eminently sensible. But to reach this high
valuation of the company, this entrepreneur had
to manage high growth and share power within
the Board of Directors with particularly demanding investors. Most entrepreneurs however, do not create a business to
grow it at a forced march and then sell it or go
public five years later. Making the decision to open up your
startup’s capital is a critical step that requires you to find and win over
investors who share your financial goals. If you were an outside investor
in a startup, would you prefer 1. the business to grow and go
public or be sold in several years, or 2. to receive regular dividends? From a strictly financial point of view, two types of shareholders
can be distinguished. Those wishing to receive regular
dividends in return for their investment and those who hope to make a significant
capital gain in the medium term. If your business or its stage
of development is incompatible with the generation of distributable
results in the form of dividends, the first category of
investors makes no sense. The second category of investors
will be quite able to wait a few years without any cash payouts in the
prospect of a large capital gain to be achieved through an IPO
or the transfer of your business. This is particularly the case
for some business angels and by their very nature venture capital
funds and private equity companies. These investors hope to recover
in the space of five years more than three times
the amount invested, but they also take the risk of
losing their entire investment. You can welcome new
shareholders into your company by selling some of your shares to them and so making a capital gain equal to the difference
between the amount of the sale and the value at which you
subscribed to these shares. Such an operation is financially
neutral for your company which does not receive
the proceeds of the sale. On the other hand, a
capital increase in cash consists of appealing to investors who will bring new equity
to develop your company. Pre-existing shareholders who do
not subscribe to the capital increase will still hold the same
number of shares, but they will be diluted
as we saw previously. It is essential to validate the
convergence of goals between shareholders. If you conduct one or
more capital increases without subscribing to them in proportion
to your percentage of ownership, you will be diluted like the example
at the beginning of this lesson. In the case of
capital-intensive activities, the founders will ultimately no
longer have control of their company, or even a blocking minority. It is therefore essential for the
founders that the visions and interests of the new investors
are aligned with theirs. This was the case for PriceMinister. Opening the capital of your
company is anything but neutral. Such an operation has many advantages, but you need to clarify
your objectives beforehand. The drafting of a business plan,
including credible financial forecasts, is a necessary step to
welcome new shareholders and ensure that they are in line with
your objectives and your strategy. Once you have decided
to open your capital, you will also have to perform
a valuation of your company to see on what basis to
carry out this operation. It is desirable and even
necessary to strike a fair deal in light of the company’s
profitability and growth potential and the liquidity of its shares. This leads us to our next lessons, in which we will discuss startup
valuation and shareholder agreements. I will of course share some new tools
with you but beyond these templates, I will insist again on the necessity of
solidarity and alignment of interests among your company’s shareholders, especially when the
company faces hard times.

************************************************************************
Welcome to lesson 2. In the previous lesson, we discussed
the process of a capital increase and spoke about an entrepreneur’s
decision to open up the capital of his or her startup
to outside investors. In these and other contexts, it is
necessary to know how to value a company. How much is your company worth? On what valuation base can you negotiate with an investor
or a potential acquirer? Let me share with you some ways
to estimate the value of a company. Remember that like real estate, the ultimate value will
depend primarily on the price that one or more buyers
will actually agree to pay. If some companies are sold cut-price,
others are acquired at premiums that surprise even the
beneficiary of the sale due to their strategic value
in the eyes of the buyer. Which indicators would you
primarily use to value a company? Sales, EBITDA, net income, assets, working capital or future cash flows. Many valuations are based
on sales, EBITDA or net income. These performance
indicators are multiplied by sector-specific
coefficients or multiples. The resultant values are then corrected for the amount of your company's
financial liabilities and cash. Several methods are sometimes combined to get an average value
or a valuation range. As an indication, and
according to your industry and your company’s stage of development, the multiple applied to sales
may vary from 0.5 to 2, or even beyond these limits. The EBITDA multiple may vary
from 4 to 8, or even beyond. The multiple applied to net
profit may vary from 7 to 14, or even beyond this interval. As you can begin to see from the
magnitude of these indicative ranges, the valuation of a company
is not an exact science. Some experts say that valuing a company is on the border of financial mathematics
and the souk of Marrakech, although it clearly leans
closer to the negotiation that prevails in this renowned
Moroccan place of trade. The website of the French National
Association of Chartered Accountants has long offered a very useful section
devoted to the valuation of companies. This section indicates the multiple
used by the tax administration to value several types of businesses,
based primarily on turnover. An insurance brokerage
company is thus generally valued at between 1 and 2
times the annual fees. A tourist hotel, between 0.7
and 3.2 times the turnover. A computer consulting firm, between
0.2 and 0.5 times the turnover. A restaurant, between 0.5
and 0.75 of the turnover and a supermarket between
13% and 25% of its turnover. Taking future cash flow
into account is essential. To refine your assessment, you
can conduct another valuation that takes into account
not only the current year, but also your medium-term
financial forecasts. This involves discounting future
cash flow by a rate of about 10% for a low risk company
in a mature sector and up to 60% for a project
that is still very risky. The discount rate is used to estimate
the present value of future cash flow. This rate represents compensation
both for the time value of money and for risk. It varies according to a
company’s stage of development and the risk aversion of each investor. Thus, the present value of an asset
that would be worth €6M in three years, applying a discount rate of 26%, is 6 / [(1 + 26/100) ^ 3] = €3M. Discounting is the reverse
process of compounding. €3M invested for three years
at a yearly rate of 26% will be worth €6M in the future. The discount rate and
multiplier coefficients vary depending on your industry
and the maturity of your business. If you apply these
methods to your business, you will obtain a valuation range. The valuation determined with one method can sometimes be double the
valuation determined by another, or even much more. These different valuations
constitute a basis for reflection to determine a reasonable value. Keep in mind that there are
three main valuation methods. An asset-based approach based on the valuation of the
corrected net assets of a company. In addition to the debts and
the real assets of a company, this approach takes into account
the potential capital gains and/or losses for some assets. A comparable company
valuation technique, based on the determination
of the profit multiples at which similar companies are valued and the application of such 
multiples to the sales, EBITDA or net income of the
company of interest. A discounted cash flow, DCF analysis based on a company’s
projected free cash flow. This approach emphasizes
the company’s future economic and financial prospects and its
concrete ability to generate cash. This last type of valuation
based on free cash flow is edifying because it makes
sense to value an activity on the basis of the
cash it will generate. This method makes it
possible to understand why certain startups still in deficit,
can have considerable valuations if their potential for generating
future cash flow is strong. However, as you will see, this valuation
method is extremely sensitive to your margin and
growth rate assumptions. Other valuation methods are variants
of the previous three methods.

************************************************************************
Hello. In the last video, we introduced the main
methods used to value a company. In this video, we will
go into greater depth with regards to the discounted
cash flow valuation method and end with a word on the valuation
of tech companies and SMEs. Entrepreneurs and investors often
dream of creating the next unicorn. This term refers to a startup
valued at over $1bn. Some promising startups however,
end up as “penny stocks”, meaning that they are traded
at a very low share price and have a small market capitalization. Valuation methods based on
multiples of sales or profits do not always apply to startups
that burn huge amounts of cash before sometimes becoming
real cash machines. You have heard about impressive
valuations of former startups like ICQ, YouTube, Instagram,
WhatsApp and Uber. Among these companies,
some examples show that startups currently
losing more than $1bn can nonetheless be valued
at tens of billions of dollars. This paradox can be explained
by the DCF valuation method, which takes expected future
cash flow into account. Let’s see a first example
of a DCF valuation. Let’s now go back to my
financial tool, FastValo, which is available on the platform. We shall examine a company
called LifeStyleRocket. The tab named ValFlux
shows the components of a discounted cash
flow-based valuation. The main default assumptions
are the following. A current turnover of €250k. A yearly sales growth of 20%. An EBITDA margin of 20%. A corporate tax rate of 25%. Working capital requirements
estimated at 16.7% of the company’s turnover. Capital expenditure of €12k,
growing at a yearly rate of 15% and a discount rate of 15%, also called WACC or weighted
average cost of capital. The free cash flow
generated by this company is also called cash from operations. This free cash flow is
calculated as EBITDA reduced by the corporate tax rate, minus CapEx and the
change in working capital. All future free cash flow is then
discounted at our 15% discount rate. Hence, the present value of
the company’s free cash flow over the next 10 years is €300k, which happens to be equal to the
forecasted amount of next year’s sales. But we also have to make an
assumption about the free cash flow beyond the next 10 years. We assume a perpetual or
terminal growth rate of g = 2.1% for the free cash flow and use
the Gordon Shapiro formula, which demonstrates that
the present value at year 10 of the future cash flow
occurring after 10 years equals the last anticipated
free cash flow multiplied by one plus
this terminal growth rate. This result is then
divided by the difference between the discount rate
and the terminal growth rate. We then have to discount this amount to obtain the present value
of the terminal value. If you do the math, you will find that the present value today
of this terminal value equals €300k. Hence our company’s valuation
would be 300 + 300 = €600k. How to explain stellar valuations? In our previous example,
we anticipated a nice growth and a fair EBITDA margin, leading to a valuation of two times
the company’s forecasted turnover for the next year. This is decent but far from exciting for private equity firms and
even for business angels. If we now take the same parameters
but assume much better profit margins and a higher growth rate of sales, what would the company’s
valuation be? Let’s just change two parameters. Our EBITDA margin
moves from 20% to 60%. The yearly growth rate of sales
also changes from 20% to 60%. Please just input these new parameters
and before viewing the result, try to guess the new valuation. If you look at the bottom
of the spreadsheet, you will notice that our
valuation is now about €30M€. That is 50 times higher
than the previous valuation. With steady growth and
high profit margins, you can change a small lifestyle
company into a skyrocketing SME. This also demonstrates the danger
of some valuation processes where entrepreneurs start daydreaming and forget their true
growth and profit potential. If you play with this Excel file, you will notice the extreme
sensitivity of DCF valuations to even slight changes
in some key parameters such as margins, growth
rates, tax rates, working capital requirements and,
of course, the discount rate, also called the weighted
average cost of capital. With these two examples, you can now understand better why
some currently loss-making companies enjoy huge valuations, if investors and
financial analysts believe that they will generate huge
positive free cash flow in the future. What do we learn from tech
exits and traditional SMEs? The financial studies of the
investment bank Avolta Partners on startup valuation and the
exits of European tech companies are extremely useful, since they are
based on thousands of real transactions. These transactions are detailed
by business model, by industry and by type of purchaser. The "Tech Exit Transaction
Multiples Europe 2018" study indicates that tech exit transactions
were based on a median multiple of 4.1 times the companies’
turnover over the last 12 months. The range oscillates between
1.6 for the first quartile and 9.2 for the third quartile. My colleague Gilles Lecointre, has carried out a great number
of business valuations, provides a fairly robust rule-of-thumb,
that as a first approach, values a traditional SME "once
its past and twice its future". In other words, this valuation is the
company’s equity plus twice its EBIT. Of course, you then subtract the
net debt, debt minus cash available, to get the final valuation. That’s almost all for this journey in
the fancy world of valuation methods. However, before concluding this lesson, let me just present two fast
calculations used by VCs to negotiate startup valuations.


c:\users\shake\documents\data\epgp\hec\ef\w4\subtitle (9).txt
************************************************************************
Welcome back. In this video, we will wrap up
our discussion of valuation by looking at two rules of thumb
used by VCs to negotiate valuations and by considering various factors that
may affect a startup’s valuation range. Venture capitalists sometimes use a
very simple rule to negotiate valuations. If they wish to control about one third
of a startup after a capital increase, they will negotiate a
pre-money valuation which is two times the
new equity requested. Hence the rule pre-money
equals two times new money. If this rule applies and if
you are looking for $2M to develop a promising startup, investors may try to negotiate a
pre-money valuation of around $4M. If this is the case, you should look
for as much money as possible. There is also a
symmetrical rule of thumb, because startup founders generally
wish to control their company for as long as possible. They therefore try to avoid dilutions
over 25% at each financing round to remain above 50%
after a series B round. In our next lesson, we’ll talk
about shareholders’ agreements. Just note at this stage
that a series A round refers to a company's first significant
venture capital financing round. The next round will be
called series B, and so on. These two opposite valuation rules
followed by VCs and founders sometimes result in a compromise
where the VC takes an ownership stake that is between 25% and 33%. I once participated in a venture
capital investment committee where the founders of a very
promising social networking app enjoying a huge traction
were looking for €5M with a pre-money valuation of €12M, which would have resulted
in a 29.4% dilution. Despite this large pre-money valuation, the deal was strongly
recommended by the VC because a tremendous
upside was anticipated. Guess what? We missed the deal because another fund proposed an even higher
pre-money valuation and therefore less
dilution for the founders. Let’s now move to
another VC rule of thumb, in which VCs anticipate
their potential upside. VCs may also use a kind
of backward calculation derived from three parameters. The expected exit value. The amount of required new equity and the desired money multiple. Using these parameters,
a VC can calculate the appropriate pre-money
valuation as follows. The pre-money valuation equals the exit
value divided by the money-multiple minus new equity. The share price will be
the pre-money valuation divided by the number
of existing shares. Let’s take an example to
illustrate this reasoning. Consider a startup
requiring $2M in new equity before a potential exit. If a VC fund plans to invest $2M
and expects an exit in five years when the startup is acquired for $15M
and desires a money multiple of 3, the pre-money valuation required to
achieve the VC’s desired money multiple will be 15 ÷ 3 - 2 = $3M. If there are currently 1M shares, the price of the new
shares should be $3. You are now familiar with numerous
valuation tools and methods, but don’t forget that other factors may have a significant
influence on valuation, notably the economic situation and the perceived quality of a
company’s management team. Beyond the previous
normative approaches, the quality of the management
is an essential valuation factor, whatever a company’s
stage of development. Cyclical factors are also likely to impact
significantly the valuation range. During the internet craze
at the end of the 1990s, some financial veterans remembered
that in a hurricane, even turkeys can fly! Unfortunately, few
people listened to them. After the burst of the dot.com
bubble in March 2000, many stocks that had risen on the
equity markets plummeted in value, sometimes cut tenfold
from their highest price. The valuation of non-listed companies
was affected by this general depression. Such episodes are likely
to recur in the future. One of the many challenges of
the transfer of companies for a CEO is to succeed in developing a structure
that will function without them when they had been busy assembling,
oiling and supervising the operation of its smallest wheels. With the exception of the DCF approach, conventional valuation
methods do not always explain the quasi-stratospheric valuations of companies with strategic
assets such as patents, because the commercial development
potential of these companies is often realized after
five years or more. For example, a biotech company
cannot achieve any turnover and will accumulate considerable losses
while seeing its valuation grow steadily and reach tens of millions of euros
because of its patent portfolio, the stage of development of its molecules and the prospects for industrial
agreements with Big Pharma. We can conclude this lesson by saying
that an early stage company valuation is driven more by enthusiasm and hope. Later on, this valuation
become more rational, because it will be based on more
tangible performance indicators. In the end, you will define a
valuation range for your company that will include a threshold below
which you will probably refuse any purchase offer as disadvantageous and a ceiling beyond which you will
seriously consider selling your company because the proposed
price is just outstanding. By mixing different valuation
methods, you will define a price range you may choose to consider true or ignore
according to political considerations. The debate can be framed
by rational considerations, but the determination of the final
price remains primarily a matter of choice and negotiation.

************************************************************************
Welcome to the last
lesson of this course. In the previous three
lessons of this module, we discussed the process of a
capital increase, valuation methods and the key features of a
shareholders’ agreement. In this lesson, we will
conclude our discussion of financial engineering and
entrepreneurial finance in general. We will begin by presenting
some financial instruments available to finance startups and will address the question
of extreme valuation ranges. There is a wide range of
equity-based financial instruments available to help you fund your company, ranging from what is called a SAFE,
a simple agreement for future equity, to quite sophisticated
pre-IPO instruments involving equity, warrants
and convertible notes. But let’s keep it simple at this stage. Just note that a SAFE can be used
as quick financing for your company, delaying the realization
of a capital increase. Do you know what a SAFE is? A SAFE is not a loan or
an equity investment. It is an agreement between
an investor and a company, where the investor will receive shares
as soon as a future equity investment reaches a given share price. The SAFE investor will
generally obtain the shares at a 20% to 30% discount
on the future share price. The agreement specifies a cap and a
floor for the discounted share price, but the mechanism remains
quite simple and inexpensive. It is widely used, notably by prominent startup
accelerators such as the Y Combinator. As your company grows, you will have access to more
sophisticated financial instruments and even if you have a
solid financial background, you will probably have to hire
a CFO to handle all the tasks related to financial strategy, reporting,
risk management and planning. For example, the cofounders of
Big Mamma hired a CFO quickly to accelerate their company’s
growth and focus on the opening of bigger and bigger restaurants. By doing so, they have been
able to take more vacations than most entrepreneurs and are even more
productive and creative! Let’s also address the
question of extreme valuations. In our previous lessons, we
addressed standard valuation ranges based on standard
multiples of profit levels. However, we saw that some valuations
may be a multiple of 50 or more, when a company has
very promising growth and future profitability prospects. The importance of a company’s
growth and profitability prospects explains why companies with huge
losses in 2017, like Tesla and Uber, enjoyed stellar valuations
of tens of billions of dollars. We could take many other
examples where valuation levels are a real leap of faith
from enthusiastic investors. But what happens when a company
shows less traction than expected and if its prospects become disastrous? If such a company requires
an urgent recapitalization, on what pre-money valuation will
the new equity investment be made? According to you, will
such a valuation be based on the last post-money valuation, i.e. with no upside on
the previous share price? On a lower valuation reflecting the prospects of the company
in the absence of a recapitalization? Or, third option, simply on the book
value of the company’s share capital, i.e. the number of shares outstanding
multiplied by the par value? These are all relevant benchmarks
but if your house is burning, your bargaining power to sell it on
the spot to a bystander is quite weak, even if you are a talented negotiator. In the case of urgent recapitalization, the worst option is to find no investor. Then the company goes bankrupt and the founders and shareholders
owning common stock generally lose everything. But there is a second, worse
option, called a wash out, when all the existing
shares become worthless and the new investors
control the whole company. I experienced a wash out in a Silicon
Valley startup, created by a friend. After the burst of the internet bubble, this was the only way
to save the company and I learned the meaning
of two financial sayings. “Pay to play.” “Old money is old money.
New money is new money.” The existing shareholders
would have lost everything if they had not participated
in the new financing round. As a board member, I could only save my friend, who
was the CEO of the company. I suggested a resolution that
if the company were sold, the CEO would get 10% of the deal, which was a 10% stake of preferred
shares, on a fully diluted base. The board, which was controlled
by the new investors, accepted, but only because the CEO was essential
to the company’s development. Otherwise, the CEO would have
been fired without hesitation and so would I, as a
simple board member. Ultimately, this company was acquired, and the CEO got
something out of the deal. Guess what, he founded another startup, which is often the case for
passionate entrepreneurs. As we have already seen,
finance can be ruthless and in some cases, you may be happy
to be supported by fair investors, so long as they continue to
believe in you and your company.
